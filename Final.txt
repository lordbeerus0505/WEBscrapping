OnePlus six point zero may soon be unveiled as the Chinese brand s latest smartphone as several rumours have already started surfacing online While we saw a mid-yearly upgrade with the OnePlus 5T in two thousand and seventeen point zero the OnePlus five point zero is due to get a major redesign by June and this model can be expected to be called the OnePlus six point zero Interestingly OnePlus six point zero could be one of the many smartphones which are expected to come with an iPhone X-like notch While previous image leaks had suggested some of the features in the handset a new report has revealed more information about the upcoming smartphone including screenshots and benchmark scores OnePlus six point zero specifications design As per Android Central a source familiar with OnePlus plan has claimed that the OnePlus six point zero will have an iPhone X-like display notch and pack some high-end specifications including the Snapdragon eight hundred and forty-five point zero processor Additionally the leaked screenshots showcase a large status bar further confirming the notch Also the OnePlus six point zero is expected to have a display with nineteen point zero nine point zero aspect ratio taller than the eighteen point zero nine point zero panel of the OnePlus 5T The new aspect ratio essentially makes up for the space lost by the notch According to the leaked images the prototype OnePlus six point zero with the model number A6000 scored two point zero seventy-six point zero five hundred and ten point zero in the AnTuTu benchmark The benchmark score beats every Android smartphone which could mean that the OnePlus six point zero could come with the Snapdragon eight hundred and forty-five point zero SoC This is not surprising as OnePlus CEO Pete Lau in January had announced that the next flagship phone from OnePlus will be powered by the new processor This adds to a previous report which had revealed specs like 6GB RAM 64GB inbuilt storage Android eight point zero one point zero Oreo and a vertical dual-camera setup Photo Credit Android Central Notably Lau had confirmed earlier that the company s next flagship would be launched in the latter part of Q2 two thousand and eighteen point zero which suggests the phone might be launched before June end It is important to take the leaks with a pinch of salt but we will likely be hearing a lot more about this smartphone in the next few months
